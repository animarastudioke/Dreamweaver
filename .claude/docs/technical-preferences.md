# Technical Preferences

<!-- Populated by /setup-engine. Updated as the user makes decisions throughout development. -->
<!-- All agents reference this file for project-specific standards and conventions. -->

## Engine & Language

- **Engine**: Godot 4.6
- **Language**: GDScript
- **Rendering**: Mobile renderer (Forward Mobile) — required for Android target; avoid Forward+-only features
- **Physics**: Jolt (default 3D physics engine in Godot 4.6)

## Input & Platform

<!-- Written by /setup-engine. Read by /ux-design, /ux-review, /test-setup, /team-ui, and /dev-story -->
<!-- to scope interaction specs, test helpers, and implementation to the correct input methods. -->

- **Target Platforms**: Mobile (Android primary; architecture supports later Web export)
- **Input Methods**: Touch (swipe: left/right/boost/brake), optional on-screen buttons as accessibility alternative
- **Primary Input**: Touch
- **Gamepad Support**: None
- **Touch Support**: Full
- **Platform Notes**: Controls must be touch-first with swipe gestures as primary input and near-zero input delay; on-screen buttons are a required accessibility alternative, not optional polish. No hover-only interactions. UI must scale across 16:9 and modern tall-screen aspect ratios, and remain usable on low-end Android devices.

## Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `PlayerController`)
- **Variables**: snake_case (e.g., `move_speed`)
- **Signals/Events**: snake_case, past tense (e.g., `health_changed`)
- **Files**: snake_case matching class (e.g., `player_controller.gd`)
- **Scenes/Prefabs**: PascalCase matching root node (e.g., `PlayerController.tscn`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_HEALTH`)

## Performance Budgets

- **Target Framerate**: 60 FPS on mid/high-end Android; 30 FPS minimum floor on low-end devices
- **Frame Budget**: 16.6ms (60 FPS target)
- **Draw Calls**: <150 per frame — mobile-appropriate budget for stylized 3D
- **Memory Ceiling**: ~512MB working set — target low-end Android headroom

## Testing

- **Framework**: GUT (Godot Unit Test)
- **Minimum Coverage**: No fixed percentage target — coverage is driven by the story-type gate in `.claude/docs/coding-standards.md` (Logic/Integration stories require automated tests as a BLOCKING gate)
- **Required Tests**: Balance formulas, gameplay systems, networking (if applicable)

## Forbidden Patterns

<!-- Add patterns that should never appear in this project's codebase -->
- [None configured yet — add as architectural decisions are made]

## Allowed Libraries / Addons

<!-- Add approved third-party dependencies here -->
- [None configured yet — add as dependencies are approved]

## Architecture Decisions Log

<!-- Quick reference linking to full ADRs in docs/architecture/ -->
- [No ADRs yet — use /architecture-decision to create one]

## Engine Specialists

<!-- Written by /setup-engine when engine is configured. -->
<!-- Read by /code-review, /architecture-decision, /architecture-review, and team skills -->
<!-- to know which specialist to spawn for engine-specific validation. -->

- **Primary**: godot-specialist
- **Language/Code Specialist**: godot-gdscript-specialist (all .gd files)
- **Shader Specialist**: godot-shader-specialist (.gdshader files, VisualShader resources)
- **UI Specialist**: godot-specialist (no dedicated UI specialist — primary covers all UI)
- **Additional Specialists**: godot-gdextension-specialist (GDExtension / native C++ bindings only)
- **Routing Notes**: Invoke primary for architecture decisions, ADR validation, and cross-cutting code review. Invoke GDScript specialist for code quality, signal architecture, static typing enforcement, and GDScript idioms. Invoke shader specialist for material design and shader code. Invoke GDExtension specialist only when native extensions are involved.

### File Extension Routing

<!-- Skills use this table to select the right specialist per file type. -->
<!-- If a row says [TO BE CONFIGURED], fall back to Primary for that file type. -->

| File Extension / Type | Specialist to Spawn |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Game code (.gd files) | godot-gdscript-specialist |
| Shader / material files (.gdshader, VisualShader) | godot-shader-specialist |
| UI / screen files (Control nodes, CanvasLayer) | godot-specialist |
| Scene / prefab / level files (.tscn, .tres) | godot-specialist |
| Native extension / plugin files (.gdextension, C++) | godot-gdextension-specialist |
| General architecture review | godot-specialist |
